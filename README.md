Massive thanks to the people who have created various tutorials that have helped me learn more about django, such as the people over at https://realpython.com and https://djangogirls.org. If it wasn't for tutorials like this I probably wouldn't have started (though I am sure some might say I should have stuck with not starting at all!).
